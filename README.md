Iris Dataset Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification model built using Python and scikit-learn to classify data from the Iris dataset. The model employs the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the species of Iris flowers based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to:

   . Load and preprocess the Iris dataset.
    .Split the dataset into training and test sets.
    .Train a classification model using the SVM algorithm.
    .Evaluate the performance of the model using accuracy metrics.
    .Test the model by predicting the species of a sample data point.
